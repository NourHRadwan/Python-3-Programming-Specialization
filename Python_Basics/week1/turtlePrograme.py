'''The following program uses a turtle to draw a capital L 
in white on a blue background as shown to the left,
image of a navigational compass and a letter L drawn by Turtle.
The program should do all necessary set-up and create the turtle and set the pen size to 10.
The turtle should then turn to face south, 
draw a line that is 150 pixels long, turn to face east, and draw a line that is 75 pixels long.
Finally, set the window to close when the user clicks in it.
Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order. '''
